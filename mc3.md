User story 2

As a developer, I would like to be able to update the status of an issue (or task) so that I can represent the work I am doing on the board.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.Add full CRUDS support to the Issue model, ensuring that:
1.1. Tasks can be seen on a board view, organized by status.
1.2. Only product owners can create new issues.
1.3. Only developers can update an issue's status.
1.4. For now: nobody can delete an issue, we'll cover that later.
1.5. A detail view shows all the fields related to an issue.
